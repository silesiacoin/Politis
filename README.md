## Project Requirements

To run this project locally you'll need:

### `MetaMask`

As a wallet of our application we used metamask.
Please install it from [the official MetaMask site](https://metamask.io/).

### `yarn`

Yarn is the package manager of our project.
To install it on your system please visit [the official Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all dependencies of the app. Allowing you to run it with `yarn start`.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `yarn lint`

Allows you to test the current syntax of your code. The configuration of this test is set in the `.eslintrc` file. 

## App Deployment

To deploy the app please follow the steps specified in [the Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs).

## Docker

The project is fully dockerized. You can follow the instructions specified in [the Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) to create docker image specified in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
